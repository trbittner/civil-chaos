*Draft*
Although my primary intention for this blog is to document my technical journey
after a significant period of time on the management side of things, I would be somewhat
foolish to ignore my last decade of experience.  Especially since there are areas specific to
the Tech industry where management theory has an outsized impact on an engineer's day-to-day
use of technology.

The two biggest traps I see with management at all levels are (1) the desire to have a complete
understanding of the domain managers oversee or (2) the ability to quantify all aspects of 
management.  (2) can be seen as a symptom of (1), but it suffers from enough of its own 
dysfunctions that it merits a separate pillar in the Errant Ways of Management Theory.
